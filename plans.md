## Plans for themer

I will list all the plans that I have for themer right here!

These plans could be intergrated already, this file does not act as an todo list!

### Base plans

* Have themer fall back to laravels views location, located at `app/views`. There also listed in `app/config/view.php`
* Have different ways to activate a theme(s). [Read more about this here](^more_on_dif_wa_themes)


[^more_on_dif_wa_themes]: More ways to activate a theme

I want a couple of different ways:

1. List activated themes, the other of these can be changed in code.
2. From database activated theme, this is configurable by the programmer.
3. User activated theme, this is configurable by the programmer.
4. Activate themes by date and time. Most handy for christmas.

All these options will come with option number 4 in some way.
